# facerecognitionbrain-app

This website detects faces from a user-inputted image link and displays a box around them using the clarifai face detection model api (https://www.clarifai.com/). 

## How to use?

Simply make an account at the website link below. Input an image url link in the input box and click detect. The face should be detected shortly after, assuming the clarifai api is not currently down.
